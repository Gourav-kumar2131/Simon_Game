        <h3>How to play the Simon Game</h3>
        <ul class="Rule" id="rule">
            <li> <b>Objective:</b> The goal of the game is to repeat an increasingly long sequence of colors or sounds in the correct order as presented by the game</li>
            <li><b>Gameplay:</b>Simon will flash a sequence of colors (each associated with a sound) on its panel. The player must replicate this sequence by pressing the corresponding buttons.</li>
            <li><b>Starting the Game:</b> The game starts with Simon randomly flashing one color.The player must press the button that corresponds to the flashed color.</li>
            <li><b>Increasing Difficulty:</b>

                After the player successfully repeats the initial sequence, Simon will add another color to the sequence.
                The player must now repeat the entire sequence (including the new color) in the correct order.
                With each round, the sequence gets longer by one additional color.</li>
            <li><b>Winning and Losing:</b>

                If the player inputs the correct sequence, they move on to the next round, where a new color is added.
                If the player inputs the sequence incorrectly at any point, the game is over.</li>
            <li><b>Speed:</b>

                As the game progresses, Simon may speed up the sequence, making it harder to follow.</li>
            <li><b>Memory:</b>

                The game tests the player's memory, as they need to remember longer and longer sequences of colors/sounds.</li>
            <li><b>Single-player or Multiplayer:</b>

                The game can be played solo or in a multiplayer mode, where players take turns repeating the sequence. In multiplayer, when one player makes a mistake, the next player attempts the sequence.</li>
