**Features**
Interactive Gameplay: Displays a sequence of colors with matching sounds that the player needs to repeat.
Responsive Design: Works across different devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
Progressive Difficulty: The game becomes more challenging as the sequence gets longer with each round.
Pure Vanilla JavaScript: No external libraries are used, ensuring that the core logic and structure are easily understandable.

**How to Play**
Watch the sequence: The game will flash colors and play sounds in a specific order.
Repeat the sequence: Click the buttons in the same order that the lights and sounds appeared.
Progress through rounds: With each round, the sequence becomes longer and harder to memorize.
Score: The game continues until you make a mistake. Try to beat your high score by remembering the longest sequence!
