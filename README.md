**Features**<br>
Interactive Gameplay: Displays a sequence of colors with matching sounds that the player needs to repeat.
Responsive Design: Works across different devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
Progressive Difficulty: The game becomes more challenging as the sequence gets longer with each round.
Pure Vanilla JavaScript: No external libraries are used, ensuring that the core logic and structure are easily understandable.

**How to Play**<br>
1. **Watch the sequence:** The game will flash colors and play sounds in a specific order.
2. **Repeat the sequence:** Click the buttons in the same order that the lights and sounds appeared.
3. **Progress through rounds:** With each round, the sequence becomes longer and harder to memorize.
4. **Score:** The game continues until you make a mistake. Try to beat your high score by remembering the longest sequence!
